# Overview
  This study utilizes a new and robust method to assess well-being in a real-world setting, with a large sample size (Sample = 821; Prompts = 7357). Its method and insight could be generalized to assess subjective experience of any sort, with careful investment into the questions asked.


## 1) Challenge
- Lack of research on micro-level or momentary human experience
- Past result of intervention on momentary well-being might be containminated by momentary valence-of-thought (e.g. the participants might be happy just because she's thinking about pleasant things that the moment, which is not due to the factor or intervention of interest)
- A mind-wandering mind is an unhappy mind?
  

## 2) Aim
- Use experience sampling method to study how momentary well-being is influenced by other subjective factors. 
- Include a valence-of-thought question and later take it into control. Do a more robust assessment on the effect of attention state on momentary well-being by taking valence-of-thought into consideration.
- Explore the effect of activity and other subjective experience on momentary well-being.

## 4) Method

### Generalized linear mixed effect modeling 
- Attention State (and Controllability, and their interaction) as the fixed effect(s)
- Participant ID and their Current Activity are crossed random effects

### Approach of reporting
- Significance test of model comparison (a full model vs. a lesion model without the effect of interest)
- Partial eta-square
