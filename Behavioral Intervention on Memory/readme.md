# Background
If you randomly tap on someone’s shoulder and ask what were you thinking just now, it’s highly probable that she’d say, “I was just talking to myself up in my head”. Evidence shows this form of internal self-directed talk takes around a fourth of adults’ conscious time. Interestingly, we sometimes talk to ourselves out loud. Researchers call the silent self-talk “inner speech”, and out-loud self-talk “private speech”. As a researcher, I’m interested in what does private speech do to us, and why is it still there for adults.

My interests in private speech started out of this behavior in children. My qualification paper was a literature review on the past decade’s private speech studies. Private speech in childhood is really common to observe and has been studied quite extensively. It has been linked with, autobiographical memory, planning performance, emotion regulation, etc. However, the takeaway of what I learn about the field that the cognitive influence of private speech in children is not as established as it seems.
First, many of the studies are correlational in nature. For instance, if a group of children use private speech more, or a certain kind of private speech more, and they out-perform those who were relatively quiet. Then private speech would be an indicator of higher capacity. But it’s unclear if it’s private speech that help them get there, or there’s a third factor like intelligence or maturity that contribute to both. 
Not that many studies control the relevant factors or trying to draw causal relationship of private speech. Further, some of the testing paradigm are not very clean after careful examination. So few studies have examined the causal link clearly. 

When it comes to my empirical study on it. I want to clarify the causal relationship of private speech in childhood with a clean paradigm. Before I started testing kids, my academic advisors suggest that we test it on adults first. 

So I also did literature review on private speech in adults and found very limited study on it. Only a couple of research groups are investigating external self-talk in adults. Their approaches are usually to observe how private speech frequency and its type shift with the task demands. For instance, adults are more likely to use private speech during a verbal task than non-verbal task. Further, private speech frequency reduces with the task being repeated. Virtually none of them try to assess potential active role of private speech on adults’ cognitive performance. 

I’d say it’s understandable, but problematic to ignore the potential active role of private speech in adults' cognition. First, why is it understandable: the dominant theory of private speech development proposes a *temporary* role of private speech. Private speech is only helpful during a certain period of time but is destined to evolve into inner speech, a more matured form of self-talk before adulthood. Many developmental literature attest to this idea and found that the frequency of private speech peaks during preschool period, after when private speech is much less likely to be observed. 

Ok if both the influential theory and the empirical evidence suggest that people just naturally use private speech less after middle childhood, then why is it problematic to not investigate into the active roles of private speech in adulthood. Why we still think current researchers are misunderstanding private speech in adulthood? 

First, relevant literatures suggest private speech is probably doing something more active than just accompanying the behavior, second, one of our preliminary experiment also suggest something similar

Two lines of literature shows that, the out-loud nature of private speech might serve additional function on adults’ cognitive performance than inner speech can do.
First, hearing a label of the target improves people’s sensitivity of finding the target in a detection task. Interestingly, a visual preview of the object do not improve people’s sensitivity to the same extent. Further, if you are supposed to find a target during a visual search task, saying the target’s name make you faster in finding it than keeping quiet.   Just to related this with real-life, repeating the last few items on your grocery list aloud while searching from walls of items is not only a task reminder, but it also makes us more perceptive shoppers. Private speech is a natural way that people use to provide themselves with these audible labels, or meaningful inputs in general, as people solve their daily tasks. 

Second, research suggests reading words aloud betters memory more than reading the materials silently. The memory benefit of reading aloud than reading silently is robust, and a recent evidence suggest that this benefit holds when the material is pictorial. Specifically, generating a name aloud for the visual cues is associated with a higher sensitivity (d’) than generating a name for the visual cues silently. Since oral production improves memory more than silence, it is reasonable to generalize that private speech as the external self-talk should have a promising role for memory, too. 

So the relevant literature suggest that the out-loud nature of private speech might be a boon to adult’s memory performance, rather than just accompanying their behaviors. 
We also conducted a preliminary experiment that suggests similar things.
What we did was, manipulating people’s use of private speech while they are doing a memory task, and see if their memory performance is changed by the manipulation.
We recruited adults and children participants in the study.    Since we want to use a clean testing paradigm to clarify the causal link of private speech on children’s cognitive performance,     and put the indications of functions of private speech in adults into test.    Additional benefits of recruiting both populations in the same task include that, we can roughly compare the effect of private speech manipulation between the two populations, and the content of private speech they were using when putting them into the same context. 
-- We used a testing paradigm called Concentration, it's a card-matching game that is interesting for both population to finish, and its instruction is easy to get for children, and people are not bothered by doing it repeatedly. 

The card-matching game Concentration was administered on an iPad in the laboratory. All cards were face-down at the beginning, the participants were asked to tap the screen to reveal the pattern of each card. If the pattern of the upcoming card is different from the previous one, then it’s a “mismatch”, and both cards automatically flip down. However, if the two cards share the same pattern, it means a “match”, and both cards disappear from the screen automatically. The player needs to memorize “where did they see which card” in order to finish the game efficiently. 

We tailored the task difficulty for the two populations by manipulating the number of cards they need to match. The adults were given 6x6 array of cards during the game, whereas the preschoolers were given 4x4 array of cards. The two *dependent* measurements are: 1) The time that the participant takes to finish collecting the hidden matching pairs in each trial. 2) The number of taps the participant takes to finish in each trial. Before each trial starts, the participants were prompted to finish the trial using as few taps as they can and as fast as they can. 
Each participant was asked to play the game twice, and the sequence of private speech conditions were counterbalanced. The participants were asked to talk to themselves or to verbalize their thoughts out-loud as much as they can in one trial (Encouraged condition) and keep quiet in the other trial (Discouraged condition). 
The card patterns were emojis, and their locations and patterns were randomized by the iPad after each trial was finished.

What we found was, First, neither populations’ time to finish the trial was changed significantly by the private speech manipulation. So an average participant took similar amount of time to finish collecting the matching pairs when using private speech or quiet.

However, we found that both populations used fewer taps to finish when they were asked to think aloud as much as they can during the game than when they were asked to keep quiet. This means that private speech reduces memory error.

Based on the effect size, private speech seems to have a larger benefit on children than adults, but note that the Discouraged condition has an inhibitory nature for preschoolers since it is established in the literature that kids use private speech naturally. A neutral group for preschoolers, where no speech instruction is provided, will be added to the future research design to remedy this issue. 


Since we asked participants to use private speech as much as they can during the encouraged condition. How much did participants talk and does the extent to which they talk impact their performance? 
--- When answering these questions, we also want to take a relevant factor into consideration, which is participants’ performance during the discouraged condition. For adults, at least, it is fair to say that the discouraged condition performance is a baseline measurement for them. So the questions now becomes, if and how does rate of private speech contribute to memory performance over-and-beyond what can be accounted for by the baseline performance? Further, does the influence of private speech rate depend on the baseline performance?  In other words, is there an interaction effect between private speech rate and discouraged performance on predicting the encouraged performance?
For adult participants: the performance of when they are quiet is a significant predictor of their performance when they were asked to talk . So if a participant did well in one condition, then she’s also very likely to do well in the other condition.
Rate of private speech is a significant predictor for encouraged taps on top of what was accounted for by the discouraged taps. Specifically, the more you talk, the fewer number of errors you have. 
What about the interaction between rate and the discouraged performance, does the effect of rate depends on how well they did during the discouraged performance? 

For number of taps, there’s no significant interaction. No matter how well you did during the discouraged condition, the higher the rate, the fewer errors were made. 
![](https://github.com/EvieXinqiGuo/EvieXinqiGuo_Portfolio/blob/main/Behavioral%20Intervention%20on%20Memory/EF_Rate_control_DifferentDF_Plot.png?raw=true)

For time, there is an interaction between rate and discouraged performance. So, the slope of rate on encouraged performance different across people with different discouraged performances. Specifically, for those who did well in the discouraged performance, the more people talk, the longer it takes them to finish, but for those did not do well in the discouraged performance, the faster they are to finish. 
![](https://github.com/EvieXinqiGuo/EvieXinqiGuo_Portfolio/blob/main/Behavioral%20Intervention%20on%20Memory/ET_Rate_control_DifferentDT_Plot.png)

If we look into the content of both participants’ private speech, and group them into predesigned categories, we will find that, more than half of an average adult participant’s private speech was about labeling the stimuli. But for kids, based on the current sample, they labeled the stimuli to a less extent

Since preliminary data shows that encouraging adults and preschoolers to use private speech during the Concentration game reduces their memory errors compared with keeping quiet, the plan for the near future is to develop experiments to investigate the mechanism of this benefit more rigorously.
